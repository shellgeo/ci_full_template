# **FurSpot**   
A Milestone Project completed by Shell George for the Diploma in Software Development; delivered by Code Institute.


This would be my **second** project that I have completed, and I will be submitting for my Milestone project for the Code Institute. The inspiration for this project was inspired by BuzzFeed quizzes to pass time.

## Deployment

This project was developed on [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/). 

Once this was done a repository was made in Github. This then allowed me to publish a live site for my project. I followed this [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo) to ensure that this was done correctly. 

**Steps to deploy page from a GitHub repository:**
1. Navigate to your Repository section, select the Repository you want to deploy.
2. Look for the 'Settings' option in Menu bar, and click this to view additional settings.
3. Under the settings page, locate the **Pages** section in the sidebar.
4. Under Source, select the 'None'' button and change it to Master and click Save.
5. Once the page is live you will see the following message "Your site is ready to be published at (Link to the GitHub Live Page)". This is the Link you would need to use to submit your Milestone project.

**How to fork this repository:**
1. Log into GitHub with your account.
2. Locate my repo for this project.
3. On the right side of the screen locate the 'Fork' button and click it.
4. This gives the option to create a copy in your own repository and make changes using GitPod.
5. Once you have finished with changes 'add, commit and push' to your own GitHub.
6. Click Pull Requests and select 'New Pull Request' button.

**How to clone this project to run it locally:**

1. Navigate to the GitHub Repository.
2. Above the files click the green Download Code link.
3. To clone using HTTPS click the clipboard symbol under 'Clone with HTTPS'. 
     - To clone using SSH key click Use SSH then click the clipboard symbol. 
     - To clone using GitHub CLI select Use GitHub CLI and click the clipboard symbol.
